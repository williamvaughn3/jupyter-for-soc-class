A JupyterLab extension highlighting misspelled words in markdown cells within notebooks and in the text files.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterlab-contrib/spellchecker/master/demo.gif)

The JupyterLab extension is based on [the spellchecker Jupyter Notebook extension](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/tree/master/src/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions/spellchecker) and relies on [Typo.js](https://github.com/cfinke/Typo.js) for the actual spell checking.
Spellchecker suggestions are available from the context menu. The style of the highlights can be customized in the *Advanced Settings Editor*.

The extension provides (Hunspell) [SCOWL](http://wordlist.aspell.net/) dictionaries for:
- American, British, Canadian, and Australian English
- French,
- German (Germany, Austria, Switzerland)
- Portuguese,
- Spanish

and will also use the Hunspell dictionaries installed in [known paths](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/spellchecker/search?q=OS_SPECIFIC_PATHS) which vary by operating systems.
If you use JupyterLab in a browser running on a different computer than the jupyter server, please note that the dictionaries need to be installed on the server machine.

You can add custom dictionary by placing Hunspell files it in `dictionaries` folder in one of the `data` locations as returned by:

```bash
jupyter --paths
```

You should place two files with extensions `.aff` and `.dic`, and name following [BCP 47](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5646#section-2.1) standards.
For more details, please see the [example](#adding-dictionaries---example) below.

## JupyterLab Version
The extension has been tested up to JupyterLab version 3.0.

## Installation

For JupyterLab 3.x:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab-spellchecker
```

or

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab-spellchecker
```

For JupyterLab 2.x:

```bash
jupyter labextension install @ijmbarr/jupyterlab_spellchecker
```

### Adding dictionaries - example

If `jupyter --paths` looks like:

```
config:
    /home/your_name/.jupyter
    /usr/local/etc/jupyter
    /etc/jupyter
data:
    /home/your_name/.local/share/jupyter
    /usr/local/share/jupyter
    /usr/share/jupyter
runtime:
    /home/your_name/.local/share/jupyter/runtime
```

and you want to add Polish language, you would put `pl_PL.aff` and `pl_PL.dic` in `/home/your_name/.local/share/jupyter/dictionaries` (you will need to create this folder), so that the final structure looks similar to:

```
/home/your_name/.local/share/jupyter
├── dictionaries
│   ├── pl_PL.aff
│   └── pl_PL.dic
├── kernels
│   └── julia-1.5
│       ├── kernel.json
│       ├── logo-32x32.png
│       └── logo-64x64.png
├── nbconvert
│   └── templates
│       ├── html
│       └── latex
├── nbsignatures.db
├── notebook_secret
└── runtime
```

#### Where to get the dictionaries from?

Some good sources of dictionaries include:
- [LibreOffice/dictionaries](https://github.com/LibreOffice/dictionaries) GitHub repository
- [Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/deps/hunspell_dictionaries/+/master) repository
- (if you know of any other quality resources please send a PR to add them here)

#### Using online dictionaries

An alternative to saving the dictionary on your own disk (or more accurately on the disk where jupyter-server is set up)
is fetching the dictionaries from a remote URL. This requires an Internet connection to load the dictionary
(each time when you open JupyterLab or change the dictionary), and might be useful if you are not able
to save dictionaries on disk (e.g. when using JupyterLab on JupyterHub configured by someone else).

To configure the online dictionaries go to *Advanced Settings Editor* → *Spellchecker*
and set `onlineDictionaries` to an array of JSON objects like in the example below:

```json
[
    {
        "id": "en_US-online",
        "aff": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/codemirror.spell-checker/latest/en_US.aff",
        "dic": "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/codemirror.spell-checker/latest/en_US.dic",
        "name": "My favorite variant of English"
    }
]
```

## Contributing

### Development install

Note: You will need NodeJS to build the extension package.

The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use
`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.

```bash
# Clone the repo to your local environment
# Change directory to the jupyterlab_spellchecker directory
# Install package in development mode
pip install -e .
# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab
jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
# Rebuild extension Typescript source after making changes
jlpm run build
pip install pytest
```

You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab at the same time in different terminals to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension.

```bash
# Watch the source directory in one terminal, automatically rebuilding when needed
jlpm run watch
# Run JupyterLab in another terminal
jupyter lab
```

### Before commit

Make sure that eslint passes:

```bash
jlpm run eslint:check
```

If there are any issues it might be possible to autofix them with:

```bash
jlpm run eslint
```

Run tests:

```bash
python -m pytest
```
